<h1>Fast Style Transfer using <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras">Keras</a></h1>

Rendering the semantic content of an image in different styles is a difficult image processing task. A task which a human would take days or months to complete is done within seconds using neural networks. We used pretrained models VGG-16 and VGG-19 using image and video as inputs to compare their quality of style transfer and performance. We also experimented by adding texture upon style on the content image.
